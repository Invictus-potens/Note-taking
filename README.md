This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the project root.
2. Add the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

Replace `your-supabase-url` and `your-supabase-anon-key` with your Supabase project credentials.

## Railway Deployment

- Ensure you have a `start` script in your `package.json` (already set up).
- Add your environment variables in the Railway dashboard under Project > Variables.
- Railway will run `postinstall` and then `start` automatically.

## Local Development

- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Make sure your `.env.local` or `.env` file is present with the correct Supabase credentials.
